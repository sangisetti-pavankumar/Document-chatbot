## 1. Introduction

Docker is a platform that enables developers and system administrators to build, ship, and run applications within containers. A container is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient unit that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker simplifies application deployment by abstracting away the complexities of the underlying infrastructure and ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

---

## 2. Docker Architecture

Docker architecture follows a client-server model and consists of the following major components:

* **Docker Client**: Acts as the primary user interface. It accepts commands from users and communicates with the Docker Daemon.
* **Docker Daemon (dockerd)**: A background service running on the host system responsible for building, running, and managing Docker containers.
* **Docker Images**: Templates used to create Docker containers. These images are built from a set of instructions written in a Dockerfile.
* **Docker Containers**: Executable instances of Docker images that run isolated applications.
* **Docker Registries**: Repositories that store Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public registry.

---

## 3. Key Concepts

Docker revolves around several key concepts that define how applications are packaged and managed:

* **Image**: A snapshot of a filesystem and configuration parameters. Images are used to create containers.
* **Container**: A runtime instance of an image. Containers run applications in isolated environments.
* **Volume**: A persistent storage mechanism that exists independently of the container lifecycle.
* **Network**: A virtual network layer that allows containers to communicate with each other and with external systems.
* **Dockerfile**: A declarative script containing instructions to build a Docker image.

---

## 4. Installing Docker

Docker installation involves setting up the Docker Engine and CLI tools:

* On Windows and macOS, install Docker Desktop from the official Docker website.
* On Linux, install Docker Engine using the package manager of your distribution.
* Verify the installation by checking the Docker version and running a test container.

Commands:

* `docker --version`
* `docker info`
* `docker run hello-world`

---

## 5. Docker Command Line Interface (CLI)

The Docker CLI allows users to interact with Docker components using various commands:

* `docker build`: Builds an image from a Dockerfile.
* `docker pull`: Downloads an image from a registry.
* `docker push`: Uploads an image to a registry.
* `docker run`: Starts a new container from an image.
* `docker ps`: Lists running containers.
* `docker stop`: Stops a running container.
* `docker rm`: Removes a container.
* `docker rmi`: Removes an image.
* `docker logs`: Displays logs from a container.
* `docker exec`: Executes commands inside a running container.
* `docker inspect`: Displays detailed information about Docker objects.

---

## 6. Dockerfiles

A Dockerfile is a plain text file that contains a series of instructions used to assemble a Docker image. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. The Dockerfile defines the base image, environment setup, application code, dependencies, and the command to run the application.

Common instructions include:

* `FROM`: Specifies the base image.
* `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory inside the container.
* `COPY`: Copies files into the image.
* `RUN`: Executes commands during the image build process.
* `CMD`: Sets the default command for the container.

---

## 7. Docker Images

Docker images are immutable templates used to create containers. Images are built from a Dockerfile and consist of multiple layers. Each layer represents a set of file changes. Images are identified by names and tags and can be stored locally or pushed to remote registries.

Key image management commands:

* `docker images`: Lists available images.
* `docker tag`: Tags an image with a specific name.
* `docker save` / `docker load`: Save or load images as tar archives.

---

## 8. Docker Containers

Containers are running instances of Docker images. They provide isolated environments for applications with their own filesystem, networking, and process space. Containers can be started, stopped, restarted, paused, or deleted.

Container lifecycle management commands:

* `docker run`: Creates and starts a new container.
* `docker start` / `docker stop`: Start or stop existing containers.
* `docker restart`: Restarts a container.
* `docker rm`: Deletes a container.

---

## 9. Docker Volumes

Volumes are used for persisting data generated and used by Docker containers. Unlike the container’s writable layer, data in volumes is preserved even after the container is removed.

Volume management commands:

* `docker volume create`: Creates a new volume.
* `docker volume ls`: Lists all volumes.
* `docker volume inspect`: Displays detailed information about a volume.
* `docker volume rm`: Deletes a volume.

---

## 10. Docker Networking

Docker provides built-in networking features that allow containers to communicate securely:

* **Bridge Network**: Default network for standalone containers.
* **Host Network**: Container shares the host’s network namespace.
* **Overlay Network**: Enables communication between containers across multiple Docker hosts.
* **None**: Disables all networking.

Network management commands:

* `docker network create`: Creates a new custom network.
* `docker network ls`: Lists all networks.
* `docker network inspect`: Inspects a network.
* `docker network rm`: Removes a network.

---

## 11. Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications. It uses a YAML file to configure application services, networks, and volumes. All services can be started with a single command.

Compose commands:

* `docker-compose up`: Builds, creates, and starts containers.
* `docker-compose down`: Stops and removes containers and networks.
* `docker-compose build`: Builds images.

---

## 12. Docker Registries

A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for named Docker images:

* **Docker Hub**: Default public registry.
* **Private Registries**: Custom registries hosted on-prem or in the cloud.

Registry commands:

* `docker login`: Authenticate with a registry.
* `docker push`: Upload an image.
* `docker pull`: Download an image.
* `docker tag`: Rename or re-tag an image.

---

## 13. Docker Swarm and Orchestration

Docker Swarm provides native clustering and orchestration capabilities. It manages a group of Docker Engines into a single virtual host and allows deploying services at scale.

Swarm commands:

* `docker swarm init`: Initializes a new swarm.
* `docker node ls`: Lists swarm nodes.
* `docker service create`: Deploys a new service.
* `docker stack deploy`: Deploys an entire application stack.

---

## 14. Docker Security

Docker incorporates security best practices to isolate containers and minimize risks:

* Use non-root users inside containers.
* Regularly update base images and scan for vulnerabilities.
* Apply resource limits to prevent denial-of-service.
* Enable content trust for image signing.
* Use secrets management for sensitive data.

---

## 15. Debugging and Troubleshooting

Docker provides several tools for debugging and analyzing issues:

* `docker logs`: Shows standard output and error logs.
* `docker inspect`: Displays low-level container or image information.
* `docker stats`: Provides real-time resource usage.
* `docker exec`: Allows command execution inside a running container.
* `docker events`: Streams real-time Docker events.

---

## 16. Best Practices

* Keep images small and efficient.
* Leverage multi-stage builds.
* Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
* Use specific image tags (avoid `latest`).
* Isolate applications into separate containers.

| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Startup Time         | Fast (seconds)     | Slow (minutes)         |
| Resource Consumption | Low                | High                   |
| OS Isolation         | Shares host kernel | Full OS virtualization |
| Portability          | Highly portable    | Moderately portable    |
| Management           | CLI-based          | Hypervisor-based       |

---

## 18. Common Errors and Fixes

* **Docker Daemon Not Running**: Start Docker service.
* **Permission Denied**: Add user to the docker group or use `sudo`.
* **Image Not Found**: Ensure image name and tag are correct.
* **Port Conflict**: Use a different host port.

---

## 19. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**What is the difference between Docker and a VM?**
Docker shares the host OS kernel, while VMs emulate hardware and run a full guest OS.

**Can Docker containers run different OS types?**
Containers share the host OS kernel, so you cannot run Windows containers on a Linux host and vice versa (without special support).

**Are Docker containers secure?**
Yes, but they require careful configuration. Avoid running as root and regularly patch base images.

**How to persist data in Docker?**
Use named volumes or bind mounts to store data outside the container’s filesystem.
